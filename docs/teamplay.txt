strategy
	two keepers, two attackers
		one keeper in/around each goal
		two attackers roaming the pitch
			one attacker in each half at a time
			not strict about which half you're in
			swap halves if required
		tanks have one role at a time, but may switch if required

	if friendly tank dies, go to where it died
		potentially low health enemy nearby
		only if within certain distance
		no point in travelling entire pitch (enemy will probably be gone)
		attacker willing to travel further for this than keeper

	if friendly tank attacking opponent, attack the same tank
		prioritise enemy tanks already being attacked over those not being attacked
		bring em down together
		focus killing one quickly, rather than attacking both

	every role treats snitch with same priority

	prioritise enemy carrying snitch over other enemies

roles
	goalkeeper
		positioned close to friendly goal
		shoots at opponents approching/near the goal
		blocks scoring opponents from entering goal
		physically gets between tank and goal
		if leaving position for ammo/banking then also do banking/ammo
		don't bother with health

		ammo problems?
			only go for ammo in 50(?) unit radius

	attacker
		chases and attacks enemies
		sees enemy, follows enemy, shoots enemy
		if need ammo/health/banking, go get it
		prioritise low health enemies?
		camp health/ammo to prey on vulnerable opponents

	bodyguard
		positions self between enemy and friendly with points
		acts as meat shield
		shoots enemies targeting friendly with points
		only look for health/ammo if carrying points
		otherwise, die for the cause

	distraction
		just spin around the pitch
